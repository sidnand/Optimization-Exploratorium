## My Key Learning Outcomes

## My Artifact Creation Process

My artifact creation process was in ... main parts.

1. Pick a topic I am passionate about

2. Search the internet and consult with ChatGPT about how mathematics is used within this topic

3. 

## Most Proud Artifact

The artifact I am most proud of is the optimizing trade through intermediate facilitation literature summary. This artifact was quite challenging for me because the ideas in the paper were outside my knowledge base, so it was difficult to summarize the material in a detailed matter. The mathematics in that paper was not very intuitive to me, so I qdecided not to talk much about the math outside of the main optimization problem.
