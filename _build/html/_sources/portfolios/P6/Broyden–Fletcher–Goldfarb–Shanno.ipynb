    "Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm is an iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems. It is a quasi-Newton method, meaning that it is a Newton-like method that does not require the computation of second derivatives. The BFGS algorithm is a popular choice for solving large-scale optimization problems, and it is widely used in machine learning and deep learning."
