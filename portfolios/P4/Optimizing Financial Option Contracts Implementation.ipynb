    "## Introduction\n",

    "This is a continuation of a previous notebook titled *Optimizing Financial Option Contracts - Theory*. This notebook will cover the implementation details of optimizing financial options contracts using the `scipy` library.\n",

    "### Review\n",
    "The Black-Scholes PDE is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C(S, t) = S_t N(d_1) - K e^{-r(T-t)} N(d_2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $C(S, t)$ is the price of the call option at time $t$ given the price of the underlying asset is $S$\n",
    "* $N(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\n",
    "* $d_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T-t}} \\left[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{S}{K} \\right) + \\left( r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\right) (T-t) \\right]$\n",
    "* $d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T-t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing black-scholes involves finding the price to buy an option at time $t$ which maximizes the payoff. This can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{Objective:} & \\quad \\text{Minimize}_{r, \\sigma} \\quad (C(S, t) - C_{\\text{market}})^2 \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Subject to:} & \\\\\n",
    "& C(S, t) \\geq 0 \\\\\n",
    "& C_{\\text{market}} \\geq 0 \\\\\n",
    "& r \\sim \\text{Distribution of Market Interest Rates} \\\\\n",
    "& \\sigma \\sim \\text{Distribution of Market Volatility}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to check if a given options contract is underpriced or overpriced in our current economic environment. This can be done by finding the optimal values of $r$ and $\\sigma$ that minimize the difference between the theoretical price and the market price of the option. If there is a difference between the theoretical $r$ and $\\sigma$ and the current $r$ and $\\sigma$, then this tells us that the option is either underpriced or overpriced."

    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways we can optimize the Black-Scholes model. For this implementation, we will make the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The volatility is uniformly distributed between 0.1 and 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The interest rate parameter is uniformly distributed between 0.005 and 0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Options pricing optimizing is a non-concave optimization problem. CVXPY is a convex optimization library, so it is not suitable for this problem. We will use SciPy optimization library to solve this problem. Therefore, we used `SciPy` optimization library, which is more powerful and flexible than `CVXPY` for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the non-convex nature of this problem, `SciPy` uses Sequential Least SQuares Programming (SLSQP) to solve this problem. SLSQP iteratively approximates the objective function and constraints using quadratic models, aiming to minimize the model while satisfying constraints. It updates the solution until convergence, making it effective for nonlinear optimization problems where convex techniques may not apply."

The black-scholes model will then return the theoretical price of the option. Our objective function takes the theoretical price of the option and the market price of the option as inputs and returns the squared difference between the two. We will then use the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function to find the optimal parameters that minimize the objective function."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we implemented a method to optimize financial options contracts using the Black-Scholes model and the `scipy` library. By comparing theoretical option prices with market prices, we assessed whether options were underpriced or overpriced in the current market. Our implementation utilized the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function with constraints on interest rates and volatilities. Through case studies on Tesla options contracts, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. While our method provides a practical framework for option pricing, further refinements are needed to enhance its accuracy and realism, particularly in incorporating more nuanced assumptions for market parameters."
